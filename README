The files here contain the Python code I developed for this modified version of the Columbia Card Task The code is available for other
developers who may want to modify it for their own work. To run this code you will need to download the card images and install the
required libraries imported at the beggining of the script. I used Jupyter Notebook to develop this script and I highly recommend it.


If you would like the executable files for this program or have any questions/suggestions don't hesitate to contact me at: bernardo.aguzzoli@gmail.com
